# Arbitrary TODO List for Sleex

This file serves as a place to jot down improvement ideas, features, and tasks for Sleex. It is not exhaustive and may contain items that are not currently planned for implementation, or are planned for a very distant future.

### - Migrate from Hyprland to FHTC
    
    This would involve significant changes to the configuration and setup, but could provide a more tailored experience. FHTC is a more lightweight and customizable compositor, and I can partitipate in its development, which is a plus.

### - Add notifications sound effects
    
    Implement sound effects for notifications to enhance user experience. This can be customizable based on user preferences, like if it's active or not, inactive when media is playing, etc.

### - Add a delay before password prompt dissapears in lockscreen
    
    When you clear the password prompt in the lockscreen, add a short delay before it disappears to improve usability. People likes a little time to see what they typed.

### - Add an option to change the notification popup position
    
    Allow users to customize the position of notification popups on the screen.

### - Remake the task list
    
    Redesign the task list to improve usability and aesthetics. I imagine a more thin left bar containing the folder of the task, and at the right side, the tasks, overlined when completed.

### - Add a "wiggle" effect to the volume indicator when a media is playing
    
    Implement a visual "wiggle" effect on the volume indicator. It's just eye candy, but it looks cool.
